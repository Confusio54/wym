## Biography
I am a graduate student in Prof. Rong Yu's theoretical condensed matter group, department of physics, Renmin University of China. I mainly study quantum phase transitions in iron-based superconductors by employing analytical techniques such as Feynman diagrams, renormalization group and large-N mean field theory. 
## Educational Background
2017-present   
M.S in Theoretical Physics   
Renmin University of China  
Overall GPA: 3.71/4.00  
Integrated Ranking: 1/22

2013-2017   
B.S in Physics  
Hebei University  
Overall GPA 4.15/5.00  
Integrated Ranking: 2/37
## Publications
**Y. Wang**, W. Hu, R. Yu, and Q. Si, Broken mirror symmetry, incommensurate spin correlations, and *B<sub>2g</sub>* nematic order in iron pnictides, [Phys. Rev. B 100, 100502(R)(2019)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.100502)

## Research Experience
Analytically studied an effective model that describes the magnetic phases and the symmetry-related emergent phases induced by magnetic fluctuations in iron-based superconductors using renormalization group and large-N mean field theory. (to be submitted)

Constructed a general Ginzburg-Landau theory that links the nematic order to spatial pattern of magnetic fluctuations. And explained the observed quasi-degeneracy between *B<sub>1g</sub>* and *B<sub>2g</sub>* nematic fluctuations in iron-based superconductors. (published on PRB(R))

Explained the observed phonon softening across the nematic transition in iron-based superconductors. (to be submitted)
